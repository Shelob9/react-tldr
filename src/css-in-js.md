# CSS-in-JS

Any CSS-in-JS library will work with MDX Go.
When [exporting as static HTML](/exporting), MDX Go includes server-side rendering support for [emotion][] and [styled-components][].

To make use of the built-in layout components, you'll need to install [emotion][] or [styled-components][].
